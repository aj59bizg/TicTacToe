This project is developed and tested on device using [Expo](https://expo.dev/). To run and test locally, run `npx expo start`, and open in the Expo Go app. Follow prerequisites here to set up expo locally: https://docs.expo.dev/tutorial/create-your-first-app/#prerequisites. Please ensure you have the latest version of Node installed.

All relevant code for the app is found in `App.js` (entry point) and in the files within the `components` folder. Unit tests are in `__tests__`.

A short demo video on iPhone is attached in `ticTacToeDemo.MP4`.
